- **Create Product Image Functon API Callback (POST REQUEST)**

127.0.0.1:8080/api/product/image/create

explanation on how it should be handle at the frontend:
it associate image/images to a created product(metadata) by creating the product(metadata) first then it returned the post(product) id to the client. the client then send the images/images with the post(product) id, and the server then associate the image/images and the product(metadata).

Screenshot

create product(metadata) first
![alt text]()

post(product) id stored on the client side after product(metadata) created
![alt text]()

associate the image/images to product(metadat) created
![alt text]()

    "Path": "/api/product/image/create",
